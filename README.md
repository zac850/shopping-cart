# Welcome

## Prerequisites
* Anaconda 3.7+
* Python 3.8+

## Setup

First, download (clone) to your desktop

Then, in your command line (e.g. Terminal), create a virtural enviroment (you only need to do this the first time):

 ```sh
 conda create -n shopping-cart python=3.8
 ``` 

Next, activate the virtural enviroment you just made:

 ```sh
 conda activate shopping-cart
 ```

Now navigate to the folder the game download exists in (should be your desktop, if you followed step 1):

 ```sh
cd ~/Desktop/shopping-cart
 ```

In the terminal command line, run:
```
python quickstart.py
```
